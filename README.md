# Laboratory work nr.2: Encapsulation

## Simulation

I have decided to choose a Restaurant simulation.Here 
I am goint to implement different staff members that
usually work there, like waiter, chef, owner, hostess,
sommelier.So, I figured that this will be a good starting point.

## Used Classes

Here I implemented several classes that are going to be
the pillars of my simulation.

- Customer
- Hostess
- Waiter
- Chef
- Sommelier
- Menu
- Owner
- Bill

All these classes have their own attributes and methods designed for
themselves.Thus, this simulation lets you see how a customer 
gets his certain meal.
